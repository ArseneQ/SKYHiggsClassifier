Our project addresses a fundamental challenge in experimental particle physics: the identification of rare Higgs boson events amid overwhelming background noise. Focusing specifically on the Higgs boson's decay to two Z bosons and subsequently to four leptons (H→ZZ→4ℓ), often called the "golden channel" due to its exceptional detection clarity despite its extreme rarity (branching ratio of ~0.012%) this research explores how machine learning can enhance detection capabilities beyond traditional methods.


The subtle differences between signal and background events with identical final states make this an ideal testing ground for machine learning approaches. Traditional cut-based analyses, while effective, may not fully capture the complex correlations between the kinematic variables of the particles that result from these events. 

Using educational datasets from CERN's ATLAS Open Data, we implemented a machine learning pipeline that connects particle physics domain knowledge with computational techniques.

Our methodology combines physics-informed feature engineering with neural network architecture design specifically tailored to this classification challenge. We extract and engineer critical features, including the four-lepton invariant mass and Z boson candidate masses, implement specialized handling for variable-length particle collections, and address the significant class imbalance inherent in high-energy physics data through a custom loss function. Our primary model, a multi-layer perceptron with regularization techniques, is complemented by an XGBoost implementation for benchmark comparison.

The results demonstrate strong classification performance, with our model achieving 96.99% accuracy and an F1 score of 0.9643 on the balanced test set. When evaluated on the more realistic dataset with a signal-to-background ratio of 1:100, the model maintains excellent signal detection with a recall of 0.9911 however, this comes at the cost of a high number of false positives. These findings draw attention to both the effectiveness of our model and the challenges that remain, indicating that our project has significant potential for further development through more refined techniques.

Perhaps most significantly, model interpretability analysis confirms that our classifier learns physically meaningful patterns, with the four-lepton invariant mass emerging as the leading feature in the decision-making process, which is in line with the physics surrounding the Higgs boson. While this is encouraging, it also highlights the need for further investigation to ensure our model does not become overly reliant on a single dominant feature, which could limit its generalizability or robustness. This alignment between machine learning behavior and theoretical physics validates our approach of integrating domain knowledge with data-driven techniques.

While the application of machine learning to high-energy physics is well-established, this project serves as an exploration and reinforcement of those methods, demonstrating how AI can support traditional analysis without sacrificing interpretability or physical grounding. Though applied to simplified educational data, our work replicates key steps used in real analyses and provides a foundation for further study, including potential extensions to more complex datasets or alternative Higgs decay channels.
